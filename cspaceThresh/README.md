    cspaceSliders.py    script that displays the thresholded image with sliders
    cspaceThreshImg.py  script that runs the thresholding operations
    example.py          an example of how you might use the functions
    lane.jpg            an included example image; try filtering out the sky or obtaining the lane lines
    
## use
The script `cspaceSliders.py` is the main script to include and use for your own images. Simply `import cspaceSliders` in your script and pass your `image` into the provided function `cspaceSliders.display(image)`. This function gives four outputs: the thresholded image, the colorspace used for thresholding, and the lower bounds and upper bounds of the thresholding operation. The full use line would be `binary_image, colorspace, lower_bound, upper_bound = cspaceSliders.display(image)`.

The keys `[q]` and `[esc]` will close the window with sliders and will send the output through to your variables.

The script `cspaceThreshImg.py` is simply used as a subroutine for `cspaceSliders.py` and simply contains functions to threshold the image in different colorspaces and modify the slider values into the proper ranges for that colorspace.

## web app
With another friend, I am currently developing a web application to do the same thing but through your browser (locally as well as on the internet) for a nicer interface and easy use for all who might not be using Python. Additionally trackbars sometimes get placed in a weird order (see known issues below), so the slider script could be annoying to use. Finally, OpenCV does not have a robust UI at all---it only has the bare minimum. The web app will enable much better interactivity. You can check out the current status of the web repo [here](https://github.com/alkasm/cspaceThreshWeb).

## known issues
Depending on your build of OpenCV, the sliders (trackbars) get placed in a weird order. This is a [known bug](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/5056). For those with the issue, ordering of them is somehow dependant on their name. I've added a couple spaces to some of my trackbar names to get them in a satisfactory order on my machine---I have no idea if others with this issue will have them in my same order or not. If not, at least the trackbars are labeled.

If the image height is larger than your screen resolution (minus the trackbar size, and window borders), then the trackbars will be displayed on top of your image. Simply resize the image before sending it through `cspaceSliders.display(image)` to find good values, and double check that they work on the larger image after by using the `lowerb` and `upperb` return values with `cv2.inRange(image, lowerb, upperb)`.

## possible updates
I started to create a better UI using `tkinter` (which would mitigate the trackbar ordering issues), but stopped when developing the web app. This should be launchable in a browser without internet access, so there's no use to create yet another UI.

The script could be edited to display trackbars in a separate window, which would fix problems with larger sized images. Maybe consider passing an optional argument to `cspaceSliders.display()`, or creating a different function in `cspaceSliders` to display the trackbars in a separate window.

Morphological operations such as erosion, dilation, opening, or closing are often done in-tandem with colorspace range thresholding to remove spurious bits. It would be nice to include views of these steps along with the thresholding since they also have tunable parameters (height and width of the kernel, number of iterations). However, it seems difficult to implement as these are often done in different orders. This might be easier to implement for a browser-based implementation.

## contribute
Please report any errors you find, and open a pull request if you fix. Alternatively, if you would like to port these scripts to another language which uses OpenCV, please feel free to do so and open a pull request!

Thank you!
